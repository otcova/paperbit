# Setup a Project

Paperbit is not restricted to any framework, 
here we let you choose the one which you are most comfortable with.
However, if you don't have experience with node js,
we recommend to use the HTML guide.

- [HTML](./html.md) --- Create a new project from the start in a simple, good and fast way.
- [Webpack](./webpack.md) --- Create a new project from the start in a (maybe) over engineered way.
- [React](./react.md) --- Integrate Paperbit to an existing react app.
