# Introduction

Paperbit is a library to create graphics with WebGL.
Our main goal is to let the programmer develop his own creativity.

The library gives graphical functions to draw to the canvas,
and some utilities to accelerate development.

## Get Started

To use Paperbit we need to [setup a project](./setup_a_project.md)
and understand the [core concepts](./core_concepts.md).
