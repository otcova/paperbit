# Introduction

Paperbit is a library to create graphics with WebGL.
Our main goal is to let the programmer develop his own creativity.

The library gives graphical functions to draw to the canvas,
and some utilities to accelerate development process.

## Get Started

To use Paperbit you will need to [setup a project](./setup_a_project.md)
and understand the [core concepts](./core_concepts.md).
Then you can read the documentation freely while using the library.

We also recommend to check out some [examples]() to power up,
to get inspiration
and to understand the capabilities of the library.
