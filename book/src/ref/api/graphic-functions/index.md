# Graphic Functions

For drawing to the canvas we need to create geometry.
This functions only request position and size,
the color, texture, and other configurations are managed by the [State](#state).

- [rect](./rect.md) --- Draw a rectangle from position and size
- [ellipse](./ellipse.md) --- Draw an ellipse from position and size
- [triangle](./triangle.md) --- Draw a triangle from three coordinates
- [triangleStrip](./triangle-strip.md) --- Draw a triangle strip from a list of coordinates
- [line](./line.md) --- Draw a line from a list of coordinates
