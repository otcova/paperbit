# Graphic Functions

For drawing to the canvas we need to create geometry.
This functions only request position and size,
the color, texture, and other configurations are managed by the [State](../state/index.md).

- [rect](./rect.md) --- Draw a rectangle on the canvas from a (x, y) coordinate and a (width, height) size.
- [ellipse](./ellipse.md) --- Draw a ellipse on the canvas from a (x, y) coordinate and a (width, height) size.
- [triangle](./triangle.md) --- Draw a triangle on the canvas from three coordinates.
- [triangleStrip](./triangle-strip.md) --- Draw a triangle strip on the canvas from a list of coordinates.
- [line](./line.md) --- Draw a line on the canvas from a list of coordinates.
