# Core Concepts

Paperbit has two distinct parts, the [graphics engine](#graphics-engine) and the [utilities](#utilities).

## Graphics Engine

When we create an instance of `Paperbit`, two classes are initialized.

1. **PaperbitCanvas**

Is the responsible of creating the canvas and the WebGL context.
His job is to request frames to the PaperbitAPI, 
when a frame call is complete it sends to the gpu all the data in a single draw call.

2. **PaperbitAPI**

Is the responsible of creating the frame data and managing events. 
When the PaperbitCanvas request a frame it will fire the needed events (OnStart, onDraw, onMouseMove ...).
Once the onDraw returns, it will send to the PaperbitCanvas all the geometry.

This isolation on the canvas and the api let us to create the canvas on the main thread
and use the api on a [web worker](./graphics/initialize.md#web-worker). 

## Utilities

When using a graphics library, it is always nice to have some common features in our disposal:
- [Vector](utils/vector.md) operations
- [Matrix](utils/matrix.md) operations
- [Geometric](utils/geometry.md) operations
- [Smooth](utils/smooth_bit.md) the transition of a number

They are not related in any way to the graphics engine.
The purpose of the utilities is to avoid reinventing the wheel in each project.
