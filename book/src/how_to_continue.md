After creating a project and reading the core concepts,
you should have enough background to start developing making use of the reference section.

- For creating the canvas go to [PaperbitCanvas](./ref/canvas/index.md).
- For using the api go to [PaperbitAPI](./ref/api/index.md).
- For using the utilities go to [Utilities](./ref/utils/index.md).

If you still don't know how to continue, we recommend to check out some [examples]() and read the [PaperbitAPI] documentation.
